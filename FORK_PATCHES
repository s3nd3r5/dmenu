== Filtered Entries

Manually applied a filter to the pipe arguments to omit certain entries.
Rather than supplying a filtered list, or biasing on recency, this patch omits
anything that is contained in the supplied configuration file:
  $XDG_CONFIG_DIR or $HOME/.config/dmenu/dmenu_omitlist

A simple text file that is passed into dmenu_path to filter any items you wish
to remove. Each path-item name is placed one per line.

The idea being that - dmenu is useful to have /everything/ available in it. But
some items that you would never call clash with a preinstalled program e.g:
  fire (a graphics demo) would make it so, after getting installed by mesa,
filtering for firefox you would need a minimum entry of firef which may break
what you're muscle memory is use to. Simple push fire into you list and you're
good :)

It also provide a command line tool to help add filter items from your shell:
  dmenu_omit fire
will enter that item and sort your list.

I don't know how portable this is since I wanted to omit the whitespace and that
required the usage of grep -E (which I know isn't the most portable). Feel free
to edit dmenu_omit and either supply a cross *nix way, or simply remove the
whitespace logic from the patch
